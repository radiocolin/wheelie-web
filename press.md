# Wheelie Launches: A Smarter, Sleeker Way to Track Your Rides on iOS 26  

**Philadelphia, PA — September 15, 2025** — Today marks the official launch of **Wheelie**, a next-generation bike ride tracking app designed exclusively for iOS 26. Built with Apple’s cutting-edge **Liquid Glass interface**, Wheelie transforms ride tracking into a dynamic, immersive experience that looks as good as it performs.  

Wheelie helps cyclists of all levels keep their rides in view with real-time speed, distance, elevation, and time tracking powered by GPS. An interactive map and compass adapt instantly whether you’re exploring new routes or navigating across town, while Live Activities and widgets keep your stats one glance away, right on your Lock Screen or Home Screen.  

Beyond tracking, Wheelie makes it easy to build a personal ride history. Save, search, and organize your rides with notes and tags, and export data in **JSON** or **KML** formats for ultimate portability. Seamless iCloud sync ensures your rides stay private, secure, and always up to date across devices.  

Designed for every rider, Wheelie supports light and dark themes, multiple languages, measurement systems, and **VoiceOver accessibility**. Siri and Shortcuts integration give cyclists hands-free control for starting, pausing, or ending a ride with just their voice.  

> “Wheelie has been a labor of love. I built the bike ride tracking app I want to use. It's full of attention to detail and delightful animations. I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed making it.”  
> — Colin Weir, creator of Wheelie  

Wheelie is free to try with **ten rides included**, after which users can subscribe for unlimited use with monthly or yearly plans.
